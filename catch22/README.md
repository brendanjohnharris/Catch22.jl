# _catch22_ - CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/146194807.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/146194807)

This is a collection of 22 time series features contained in the [_hctsa_](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa) toolbox coded in C.
Features were selected by their classification performance across a collection of 93 real-world time-series classification problems (according to the [`op_importance`](https://github.com/chlubba/op_importance) repository).

___NOTE___: The included features only evaluate dynamical properties of time series and do not respond to basic differences in the location (e.g., mean) or spread (e.g., variance).
If you think features of the raw distribution may be important for your application, we suggest you add them (in the simplest case, the mean and standard deviation) to this feature set.

# Using the _catch22_-features from Python, Matlab and R

The fast C-coded functions in this repository can be used in Python, Matlab, and R following the instructions below.
Time series are _z_-scored internally which means e.g., constant time series will lead to NaN outputs.
The wrappers for Matlab and Python run using either GCC or MSVC as compiler. The R wrapper so far only runs using GCC and was only tested on OS X.

## Python

Installation of the Python wrapper differs slightly between Python 2 and 3.

### Installation Python 3

Manual installation through `distutils`

```
python3 setup_P3.py build
python3 setup_P3.py install
```

Or using pip

```
pip install catch22
```

### Installation Python 2

Go to the directory `wrap_Python` and run the following

```
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

or alternatively, using pip, go to main directory and run

```
pip install -e wrap_Python
```

### Test Python 2 and 3

To test that the _catch22_ wrapper was installed successfully and works run (NB: replace `python` with `python3` for Python 3):

```
$ python testing.py
```

The module is now available under the name `catch22`.
Each feature function can be accessed individually and takes arrays as tuple or lists (not `numpy` arrays).
E.g., for loaded data, `tsData` in Python:

```python
import catch22
catch22.CO_f1ecac(tsData)
```

All features are bundelled in the method `catch22_all` which also accepts `numpy` arrays and gives back a dictionary containing the entries `catch22_all['names']` for feature names and `catch22_all['values']` for feature outputs.

```python
from catch22 import catch22_all
catch22_all(tsData)
```

## R

This assumes your have `R` installed and the package `Rcpp` is available.
Clang is required.

Copy all `.c`- and `.h`-files from `./C` to `./wrap_R/catch22/src`.
Then go to the directory `./wrap_R` and run the following two lines while replacing `x.y` by the current version number

```
R CMD build catch22
R CMD INSTALL catch22_x.y.tar.gz
```

To test if the installation was successful, navigate to `./wrap_R` in the console and run:

```
$ Rscript testing.R
```

The module is now available in `R` as `catch22`. Single functions can be accessed by their name, all functions are bundelled as `catch22_all` which can be called with a data vector `tsData` as an argument and gives back a data frame with the variables `name` for feature names and `values` for feature outputs:

```
library(catch22)
catch22_out = catch22_all(tsData);
print(catch22_out)
```

## Matlab

Go to the `wrap_Matlab` directory and call `mexAll` from within Matlab.
Include the folder in your Matlab path to use the package.

To test, navigate to the `wrap_Matlab` directory from within Matlab and run:

```
testing
```

All feature can be called individually, e.g., `catch22_CO_f1ecac`.
Alternatively, all features are bundeled in a function `catch22_all` which returns an array of feature outputs and, as a second output, a cell array of feature names.
With loaded data `tsData`:

```
[vals, names] = catch22_all(data);
```

# Raw C

## Compilation

### OS X
```
gcc -o run_features main.c CO_AutoCorr.c DN_HistogramMode_10.c DN_HistogramMode_5.c DN_OutlierInclude.c FC_LocalSimple.c IN_AutoMutualInfoStats.c MD_hrv.c PD_PeriodicityWang.c SB_BinaryStats.c SB_CoarseGrain.c SB_MotifThree.c SB_TransitionMatrix.c SC_FluctAnal.c SP_Summaries.c butterworth.c fft.c helper_functions.c histcounts.c splinefit.c stats.c
```
### Ubuntu:
As for OS X but with `-lm` switch in from of every source-file name.

## Usage

### Single files

The compiled `run_features` program only takes one time series at a time. Usage is `./run_features <infile> <outfile>` in the terminal, where specifying `<outfile>` is optional, it prints to  `stdout` by default.

### Mutliple files

For multiple time series, put them – one file for each – into a folder `timeSeries` and call `./runAllTS.sh`.
The output will be written into a folder `featureOutput`.
Change the permissions of `runAllTS.sh` to executable by calling `chmod 755 runAllTS.sh`.

### Output format

Each line of the output correponds to one feature; the three comma-separated entries per line correspond to feature value, feature name and feature execution time in milliseconds.
For example:
```
0.29910714285714, CO_Embed2_Basic_tau.incircle_1, 0.341000
0.57589285714286, CO_Embed2_Basic_tau.incircle_2, 0.296000
...
```

### Testing

Sample outputs for the time series `test.txt` and `test2.txt` are provided as `test_output.txt` and `test2_output.txt`.
The first two entries per line should always be the same.
The third one (execution time) will be different.
