A FeatureSet can be called on a time-series vector or matrix X (with time series occupying columns) to return a FeatureArray of feature values. Subsets of a FeatureSet 𝒇 can be obtained by indexing with feature names (as symbols) or the regular linear and logical indices. FeatureSets also support simple set operations defined for arrays, such as unions and intersections, as well as convenient syntax for concatenation (+) and set differencing (\\).
